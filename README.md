# bixby.playground.javascript
A Bixby capsule that runs through some of the javascript features on the platform.  

## textLib 
This is a great little tool for fuzzy matching and other common string manipulation helpers like levenshteinDistance, and even steming all words from a string.  

## dates
When a user says '2 weeks from next Tuesday'...the developer creates a datetime expression to handle that.  Use the 'dates.' functions using dates in your capsule.

## $vivContext
Not sure how to get the user's time zone?  There are many data elements available in your javascript by using $vivContext.

## config 
See how to use the built in config.get('[your key]')

## base64
A simple encode and decode helper.

## more to come
I'll be updating this capsule as more features are added.
